            Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on
            the internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of
            website development rather than software development. Web design
            used to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers. Web
            design is quite complex and daunting, but with the development of
            Internet and technology, web design overflow than ever before
            nowadays. Hence, becoming a web designer has become the main trend
            among young designers. During training sessions, it is taught about
            CSS, bootstrap and design part of any website, which is quite useful
            for every student for any further project or job purpose

            Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it’s
            the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look
            great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience.
            It can be range from developing simple static pages to complex
            applications. The field of web development is generally broken down
            into front-end (the user-facing side) and back-end (the server
            side).In our web development workshop, we introduced and teach them
            the building blocks of webpage. i.e., HTML5 ,CSS3, JavaScript, and
            helped the aspiring students to settle down their enthusiasm in web
            development. We guided them to design and implement a responsive
            site for being a professional and skilled web developer.

            The core thing about responsive design is flexible layout. Flexible
            layouts have flexible image and flexible text blocks that looks good
            on any screen. A responsive web design will adjust(i.e. resize,
            shrink, or enlarge) for different screen sizes automatically.
            Responsive design is a hot topic among web designers who want to
            provide a fair and smooth experience to all their users. Designing a
            good website is not enough, it should be useful for all kind of
            users using different types of devices. Talking this forward, in our
            workshops we not only teach developing a attractive website but also
            making it user friendly for a seamless user experience and a
            positive feedback.

            Adobe Photoshop is a computer application software used to edit and
            manipulate digital images. It is a powerful, industry standard
            image-editing tool for designers, artists, film & video Makers, etc.
            In order to make the basics of Photoshop clear and get started, they
            are taught about the various basic tools and their functions. In
            addition, several other concepts like layers, modes, Transform
            tools, masking, image adjustments, filters etc. were explained along
            with its demonstration to make them capable of designing posters and
            banners. Now they are proficient in creating anything they could
            imagine using Photoshop.

            A database is an organized collection of structured information, or
            data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A
            database is usually controlled by a database management system
            (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications
            that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system,
            often shortened to just database. Data within the most common types
            of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and
            columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying
            efficient. In our DBMS workshops we teach the student, how the data
            can be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and
            organized .
